## Project goal:

Profitable stock and crypto trading involve a lot of knowledge and experience in Technical Analysis. However, the fundamentals of behind technical analysis techniques, tools, resources and effective strategies can be complex to grasp, understand and even expensive to access.

## Solution:

The main point of any sort of asset trading is to make a profit. This boils down to effectively three actions based on the price movements, **&#39;When should I buy?&#39;**, **&#39;When should I sell?&#39;** and **&#39;When should I hold my current position?&#39;** to maximize my profits and minimize losses. Therefore, by using data analytics to translate real-time price movements to determine whether to buy, sell or hold based on historical price trends. This was achieved by combining a couple of popularly used trading strategies and indicators such as **&#39;Moving Average Convergence Divergence&#39;**, **&#39;Slow Stochastic&#39;**, **&#39;Relative Strength Index Divergence Convergence&#39;** etc. More so, by feeding these sequences to a Recurrent Neural Network to learn the price patterns and trader actions, the machine model could provide with the most appropriate action to be taken at any given time.
